# Background 
In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. 



## Process:

I analyzed the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare when treating cancer in mice.

Using Python and Matplotlib created several graphs to examine different trends:

* Created a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.

* Created a scatter plot that shows how the number of [metastatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis) (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.


* Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* Created a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
